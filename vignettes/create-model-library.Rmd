Model libraries are useful to have consistent high-quality basic models that can
be used as a model itself or as a building block for other models.

# Model library conventions within nlmixr2lib

Compartment and parameter names should be all lower case when on their own and
should use snakeCase when combined in some way.

Compartment and parameter names are selected to align with those used by
`rxode2::linCmt()` which are described in the vignette:
vignette("rxode2-model-types", package = "rxode2").

## Compartment naming

Compartment naming follows compartment names with the `linCmt()` with
augmentation for other compartments:

* `depot`: The extravascular dosing compartment (for example, the gut for oral
  dosing or subcutaneous space for subcutaneous dosing)
* `central`: The intravascular compartment used for intravenous dosing or for
  typical pharmacokinetic (PK) model samping of the drug
* `peripheral1`, `peripheral2`: The first and second peripheral compartments for
  2- and 3-compartment PK models
* `effect`: The compartment for effect compartment models

## Parameter naming

PK models should use the following parameter naming conventions:

* `ka`: absorption rate
* `cl`: clearance
* `q`: intercompartmental clearance (`central` to and from `peripheral1`
  compartments)
* `q2`: second intercompartmental clearance (`central` to and from `peripheral2`
  compartments)
* `vc`: central volume of distribution
* `vp`, `vp2`: first and second peripheral compartment volumes

When micro-constants are used, they should use the following naming conventions:

* `kel` elimination rate (`cl/vc`)
* `k12`, `k21`, `k13`, `k31`: intercompartmental transit rates (`q/vc`, `q/vp`,
  `q2/vc`, and  `q2/vp2`, respectively)

## Parameter transforms

Parameters are often estimated on a transformed scale.  For instance, a natural
logarithm transform is often used for parameters that must be positive, and a
logit transform is often used when a parameter must remain within a specific
range.

Transformed parameters should be prefixed with an indicator of the
transformation.  Preferred transformation prefixes are:

* `l` (lower case L): natural log transform
* `logit`: logit transform
* `probit`: probit transform
* Any other transform should similarly include the full transform as the prefix

Generally, for any transform other than natural logarithm, include the full name
as a prefix.  For example, natural logarithm-transformed `ka` would be `lka` and
logit-transformed `emax` would be `logitemax`.

## Random effects

Random effects are estimates as part of a distribution varying by some grouping
facter.  The grouping factor is often a subject in a clinical trial.  (For
NONMEM users, random effects are often referred to as inter-individual
variability.)

Random effect parameters should prefix the (transformed) parameter name with
`eta`.  For example, a random effect on log-transformed clearance would be named
`etalcl`.

# Model files

Files in a model library should have the following characteristics:

* The first line inside the function should have a description
  assignment.  That is `description <- "This is the description of the
  model"` right inside the `function()` before the `ini({})` block.
* The remainder of the file should be an nlmixr2 model in a function with a
  typical `ini()` and `model()` block.
* The name of the file should match the name of the model within the file.

For examples, see the package installation directory.
