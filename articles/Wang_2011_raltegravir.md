- Description: Population PK model for plasma and intracellular (PBMC)
  raltegravir after a single 400 mg oral dose in six healthy male
  Singaporean volunteers (Wang 2011). Plasma PK is described by a
  one-compartment model with first-order elimination preceded by a chain
  of two transit compartments between depot and central (Kappelhoff 2005
  transit-absorption parameterisation: MAT = (n + 1) / ktr with n = 2
  transit compartments). Bioavailability F is implicit in the apparent
  CL/F and V/F. Intracellular (PBMC) raltegravir is described as an
  empirical partition of the predicted plasma concentration via the
  paper’s accumulation ratio ACR (point estimate 11.2%) with its own
  inter-individual variability and exponential residual error (Wang 2011
  Eq.: C_IC,obs = ACR \* C_plasma,pred \* exp(eps_IC)). The packaged
  model maps ACR to the canonical paper-named bare parameter `frac` and
  its log-transformed primary `lfrac`. No baseline covariates were
  retained in the final model. Note that the paper’s term ‘accumulation
  ratio’ is a misnomer in the conventional sense – ACR \< 1 means
  raltegravir does NOT accumulate intracellularly, consistent with
  simple diffusion of unbound drug into PBMCs (the authors’
  Conclusions).

Wang 2011 was a pilot pharmacokinetic study of a single 400 mg oral
raltegravir dose in six healthy male Singaporean volunteers, designed to
determine whether sustained antiviral efficacy in plasma-PK-variable HIV
patients could be explained by intracellular drug accumulation in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The population PK model
links plasma and intracellular concentrations through a simple empirical
accumulation ratio (ACR) of 11.2%, supporting the authors’ conclusion
that raltegravir does NOT accumulate intracellularly and that PBMC
concentrations can be predicted from plasma data by simple
multiplicative scaling.

## Population

Six healthy adult male volunteers were enrolled in Singapore (single
centre, National University Health System). Their median weight was 67.4
kg (range 56.5 to 87.1 kg) and median age 33.5 years (range 31 to 36).
All subjects fasted overnight and received a single 400 mg oral dose of
raltegravir on day 1 at 8 a.m. Inclusion criteria required smoking less
than 10 cigarettes per day, hemoglobin \> 10.9 g/dl, platelet count \>=
125,000/mm^3, creatinine clearance \>= 60 mL/min, and lipase or amylase
\< 1.1x ULN.

Paired blood samples for plasma and PBMCs were collected predose and at
4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h post-dose; additional plasma-only samples were
collected at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 10 h. PBMC concentrations were
computed assuming a cell volume of 0.4 pL.

CV values are converted to internal log-scale variances using
`omega^2 = log(1 + CV^2)`. The CL/F~V/F covariance is
`0.559 * sqrt(omega^2_lcl * omega^2_lvc) = 0.155`.

## Molecular-weight unit conversion

Wang 2011 reports concentrations and AUC values in nmol/L (the units of
HIV-1 integrase IC50). The packaged model uses mass-balanced mg / mg/L
(matching `Lee_2016_raltegravir`). Conversions for cross-checking
against the paper’s NCA table use raltegravir molecular weight 444.42
g/mol:

``` r

mw_ral <- 444.42  # g/mol
nm_to_mgL <- function(nm)   nm * mw_ral * 1e-6           # nmol/L -> mg/L
nmh_to_mghL <- function(nmh) nmh * mw_ral * 1e-6         # nmol*h/L -> mg*h/L

## Virtual cohort

Original observed data are not publicly available. The figures below use
a virtual population with the published Wang 2011 covariate distribution
(six healthy adult males, all in their early thirties, roughly
two-thirds of subjects between 60 and 75 kg, no other covariates
retained in the final model).

``` r

  amt = 400,

## Assumptions and deviations

- **Number of transit compartments fixed at 2 (structural).** Wang 2011
  reports n = 2 as the optimal number of transition compartments
  selected during model development, not as an estimated theta with a
  precision estimate. The model encodes n = 2 implicitly in the ODE
  chain (`depot -> transit1 -> transit2 -> central`) and ties the
  transit-chain rate constant to MAT through
  `ktr = (n + 1) / MAT = 3 / MAT`. There is no `fixed()` ini entry
  because n is not a theta; it is a structural choice that determines
  the number of `d/dt` lines.
- **Mass-balance unit choice.** The paper reports concentrations in
  nmol/L; the packaged model carries concentrations in mg/L
  (`units$concentration = "mg/L"`) and the dose is supplied as
  `amt = 400` with `units$dosing = "mg"`. The cross-checking conversion
  to nmol/L uses raltegravir MW = 444.42 g/mol. This matches
  `Lee_2016_raltegravir`’s unit convention.
- **Exponential residual error interpretation.** The paper Methods state
  “Interindividual and residual unexplained variability were estimated
  with an exponential error model” (Wang 2011 page 4091). In NONMEM this
  is Y = F \* exp(eps) with eps ~ N(0, sigma^2). nlmixr2’s
  `~ lnorm(expSd)` is the exact analogue with `expSd = sigma` on the log
  scale. Wang 2011 Table 1 reports residual error as a percentage in the
  same column it reports IIV %CV; following the standard NONMEM
  `$SIGMA`-on-log-scale reporting convention, the percentage is read as
  `sigma * 100%` (`expSd = 0.867` for plasma; `expSd_Cic = 0.649` for
  intracellular). For IIV the percentages are read as linear-space %CV
  and converted via `omega^2 = log(1 + CV^2)`, which is the standard
  nlmixr2lib convention matching `Lee_2016_raltegravir`.
- **Apparent vs. NCA half-life mismatch.** The one-compartment fit gives
  an apparent terminal half-life
  `t1/2 = ln(2) * V / CL = 0.693 * 272 / 39.1 ~= 4.82 h`, whereas the
  paper’s NCA reports `t1/2 = 7.8 h` (95% CI 5.5-11.3 h) using
  terminal-phase regression over 24 and 48 h time points. The paper
  Discussion acknowledges this: “our attempts to fit the data to a
  two-compartment model were not successful, most likely due to little
  data collected during the beta-elimination phase”. The simulated
  trajectories therefore decline somewhat faster than the late-time
  observed data; this is a feature of the published 1-compartment model,
  not a transcription error. Larger studies cited by the authors
  (Dickinson et al., Iwamoto et al.) reported either two-compartment
  fits or different one-compartment parameter estimates – consult those
  papers for a model intended for late-time extrapolation.
- **Accumulation ratio is a misnomer for raltegravir.** Wang 2011 names
  the parameter ACR (accumulation ratio) but the point estimate of 11.2%
  means raltegravir does NOT accumulate intracellularly. The packaged
  model maps this parameter onto the canonical paper-named bare
  parameter `frac` (a unitless fraction in (0, 1)); the label and inline
  comments preserve the paper’s “accumulation ratio” name and emphasise
  the (0, 1) interpretation. The paper itself states “this result is
  consistent with simple diffusion of unbound RAL into cells”
  (Discussion, page 4094).
- **Intracellular model has no separate compartment kinetics.** Wang
  2011 Eq.: `C_IC,obs = ACR * C_plasma,pred * exp(eps_IC)` – the
  intracellular concentration is an empirical multiplicative transform
  of the predicted plasma concentration, not a separate compartment with
  its own ODE. The packaged model implements this exactly as
  `Cic <- frac * Cc` followed by `Cic ~ lnorm(expSd_Cic)`. There is no
  intracellular ODE state, and PBMC isolation / processing effects
  (which the paper Discussion notes contribute to the high intracellular
  residual error of 64.9%) enter only through `expSd_Cic`.
- **Sample size is small.** Six subjects produce wide confidence
  intervals on every parameter (RSE 15-56%). The visual predictive check
  in Wang 2011 Fig. 4 covered 97% of observed concentrations, but the
  authors explicitly cautioned (Discussion, page 4094) that “large
  pharmacokinetic studies are required to further characterize the
  pharmacokinetics of RAL before the population pharmacokinetic model
  could be applied in a clinical setting.” Treat the simulated NCA
  values as illustrative rather than predictive for new dosing
  scenarios.
