## Tislelizumab population PK simulation

Simulate tislelizumab (anti-PD-1 IgG4) concentration-time profiles using
the final three-compartment population PK model from Budha et
al. (2023). The pooled analysis included 2596 patients with advanced
tumors from 12 studies (14,473 serum concentration observations).

The structural model is a three-compartment IV model with linear
elimination. Final covariates: body weight, albumin, baseline tumor
size, ADA status, and tumor-type indicators for classical Hodgkin
lymphoma and gastric cancer on CL; and body weight, age, and sex on Vc.
Tislelizumab PK were linear across the 0.5–10 mg/kg dose range, and the
approved dose is 200 mg IV every 3 weeks.

### Virtual population

Approximate the Budha 2023 Table 2 distributions for the pooled
2596-patient cohort (medians and ranges only — the paper does not
publish individual covariates or covariate correlations).

``` r
set.seed(2023)
n_subj <- 500

# Weight and age: log-normal / normal fits to reported medians and ranges
WT  <- pmin(pmax(rlnorm(n_subj, log(65), 0.20), 31.9), 130)
AGE <- pmin(pmax(rnorm(n_subj, 60, 12), 18), 90)

# Albumin (g/L): normal around median, clipped to observed range
ALB <- pmin(pmax(rnorm(n_subj, 41, 5), 17), 61.3)

# Tumor size (mm): log-normal around median 63.3, clipped to observed range
TUMSZ <- pmin(pmax(rlnorm(n_subj, log(63), 0.75), 10), 408)

# Sex: 26.0% female
SEXF <- rbinom(n_subj, 1, 0.26)

# ADA: 16.6% positive (of the 98.9% non-missing; treat missing as negative here)
ADA_POS <- rbinom(n_subj, 1, 0.166)

# Tumor type: sample from Table 2 proportions; only cHL and GC get indicators
tumtp_p <- c(
  cHL   = 0.027,
  CRC   = 0.031,
  EC    = 0.144,
  GC    = 0.039,
  HCC   = 0.122,
  NPC   = 0.008,
  NSCLC = 0.443,
  OC    = 0.020,
  UC    = 0.058,
  Other = 0.108
)
TUMTP <- sample(names(tumtp_p), n_subj, replace = TRUE, prob = tumtp_p)
TUMTP_CHL <- as.integer(TUMTP == "cHL")
TUMTP_GC  <- as.integer(TUMTP == "GC")

pop <- data.frame(
  ID        = seq_len(n_subj),
  WT, AGE, ALB, TUMSZ,
  SEXF, ADA_POS,
  TUMTP, TUMTP_CHL, TUMTP_GC

```

### Dosing dataset

Approved flat regimen: 200 mg IV q3w. Simulate 10 cycles (≈ 30 weeks)
followed by an observation tail to capture terminal disposition.

``` r
cycle_days <- 21
n_cycles   <- 10
dose_times <- seq(0, (n_cycles - 1) * cycle_days, by = cycle_days)

obs_times <- sort(unique(c(
  seq(0, 21, by = 0.5),                     # intensive profile through cycle 1
  seq(21, n_cycles * cycle_days, by = 3),   # pre/post dose through multi-dose
  seq(n_cycles * cycle_days, 365, by = 7)   # washout tail
)))

d_dose <- pop |>

  )

d_sim <- dplyr::bind_rows(d_dose, d_obs) |>
  dplyr::arrange(ID, TIME, dplyr::desc(EVID)) |>
  as.data.frame()

### Simulate

``` r

set.seed(20230331)
sim <- rxSolve(mod, d_sim, returnType = "data.frame")
#> ℹ parameter labels from comments will be replaced by 'label()'
```

### Concentration-time profile

``` r
sim_summary <- sim |>

  dplyr::summarise(
    median = median(Cc, na.rm = TRUE),

### Effect of ADA status on PK

``` r

```

### NCA validation

Run PKNCA on the first dosing interval (day 0–21) and a
pseudo-steady-state interval (cycle 10, days 189–210), stratified by ADA
status. Terminal half-life is expected to approximate the paper’s
reported ≈ 23.8 days (Budha 2023 Methods) in the ADA-negative arm.

``` r
# Per-subject treatment grouping for PKNCA
pop$treatment <- ifelse(pop$ADA_POS == 1, "ADA-positive", "ADA-negative")

# Cycle 1 interval
conc1 <- sim |>
  dplyr::filter(time >= 0, time <= 21, Cc > 0) |>

### Volume of distribution at steady state

The paper reports Vss = 6.42 L (Budha 2023 Results). With the nlmixr2
model, Vss is simply the sum of the central and peripheral volumes at
typical covariates:

``` r
vss <- 3.05 + 1.27 + 2.10
cat(sprintf("Typical-subject Vss = %.2f L (Budha 2023 reports 6.42 L)\n", vss))
#> Typical-subject Vss = 6.42 L (Budha 2023 reports 6.42 L)
```

### Assumptions and deviations

Budha 2023 does not publish individual PK or covariate tables, so the
virtual population approximates Table 2 medians and ranges:

- **Weight**: log-normal, median 65 kg, clipped to 31.9–130 kg.
- **Age**: normal, median 60 y, clipped to 18–90 y.
- **Albumin**: normal, median 41 g/L, clipped to 17–61.3 g/L. The paper
  uses g/L (SI), not g/dL.
- **Tumor size**: log-normal, median 63.3 mm (matched to Budha 2023
  Table 2 median 63.3 mm), clipped to 10–408 mm.
- **Sex**: 26% female (Budha 2023 Table 2).
- **ADA status**: 16.6% positive (Budha 2023 Table 2; 1.1% missing
  re-coded as negative for simulation).
- **Tumor-type mix**: sampled independently from Table 2 proportions;
  only cHL (2.7%) and GC (3.9%) get indicator columns — all other types
  are reference.
- **No covariate correlations** are imposed (paper does not report
  them).
- **Dose regimen** uses the approved 200 mg q3w flat dose (Budha 2023
  Methods and label); the model is also valid over 0.5–10 mg/kg per the
  PopPK dataset.
- **Infusion duration** is set to 30 min (clinical administration); the
  final PopPK model treats infusions as bolus after deriving
  concentration-time profiles from study EDC.

### Notes on the model

- **Structure**: three-compartment IV with linear elimination.
- **Reference covariates**: WT 65 kg, AGE 60 y, ALB 41 g/L, TUMSZ 63 mm,
  male, ADA-negative, non-cHL / non-GC tumor.
- **Strongest covariates on CL** (Budha 2023 Figures 6–7, not clinically
  meaningful): ±20% range of WT (0.565 exponent) and ALB (-0.457
  exponent).
- **cHL patients** have ~19% lower CL (`exp(-0.216) = 0.806`) than the
  reference tumor mix.
- **Shrinkage on V2 and V3 IIV** is high (55.8%, 44.4%). The paper
  retains these etas; this implementation follows the paper.
