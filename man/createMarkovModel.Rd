\title{Create a Markov model for `nlmixr2`}
\usage{
createMarkovModel(..., ignoreProbLt = 0, ignoreProbGt = 1, transitions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Passed to `createMarkovTransitionMatrix()`}

\item{ignoreProbLt}{Do not estimate probabilities less than the given probability. Set to 0 to estimate all probabilities with any transition chance, use `estimateZeroTransitions` to give an initial estimate when there is zero probability of transition into the state.}

\item{ignoreProbGt}{Do not estimate probabilities on a row where any probability is greater than the given probability (treating it as a collector row). Set to 1 to estimate all probabilities with any transition chance away from the state, use `estimateZeroTransitions` to give an initial estimate when there is zero probability of transition from the state.}

\item{transitions}{Use this manually-created transition matrix rather than an automatically-creating one}
}
\value{
A template `nlmixr2` model as a character string with `ini()` and `model()` blocks for the Markov model
