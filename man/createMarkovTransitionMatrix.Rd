\title{Create a Markov transition matrix with probabilities of transitioning between every state}
\usage{
createMarkovTransitionMatrix(
  colPrev,
  colCur,
  estimateZeroTransitions = FALSE,
  estimateZeroTransitionsInitial = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{colPrev, colCur}{Column names in the dataset for the previous and
current states (may be any R object that can be coerced to a character
string, ordered objects are usually preferred)}

\item{estimateZeroTransitions}{Should transitions that have zero occurrences be estimated? This is done by setting the state to have a single transition.}

\item{estimateZeroTransitionsInitial}{Should transitions that are only initial states be estimated (ignored if `estimateZeroTransitions = FALSE`)}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A square matrix with row and column names for each state where rows are the prior state and columns are the current state.
