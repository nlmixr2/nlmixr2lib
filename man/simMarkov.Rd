\title{Convert nlmixr2 simulations to Markov states}
\usage{
simMarkov(
  ui,
  initialState,
  states,
  colPrev = "previous",
  colCur = "current",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ui}{a model to simulate from}

\item{initialState}{The initial Markov state}

\item{states}{All states in the model as a character vector}

\item{colPrev, colCur}{Column names in the dataset for the previous and current states (may be any R object that can be coerced to a character string, ordered objects are usually preferred)}

\item{...}{Passed to methods}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the original data along with the new state columns added
}
